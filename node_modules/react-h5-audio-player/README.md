## UI Overwrites

React H5 Audio Player provides built-in class names for developers to overwrite.

For example:
```sass
// In a SASS or LESS file
.react-h5-audio-player {
  .toggle-play-wrapper {
    .toggle-play-button {
      // Remember to use !important to overwrite inline style.
      background-color: red !important;
    }
  }
}
```
You can find more class names by inspecting element on you browser.

To be compatible with some old browsers, you can add some prefixer to flex container

```sass
.react-h5-audio-player {
  .flex {
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: flex;
    .toggle-play-wrapper {
      flex: 1 0 60px;
      -webkit-box-flex: 1 0 60px;
      -moz-box-flex: 1 0 60px;
      -ms-flex: 1 0 60px;
    }
    .progress-bar-wrapper {
      flex: 10 0 auto;
      -webkit-box-flex: 10 0 auto;
      -moz-box-flex: 10 0 auto;
      -ms-flex: 10 0 auto;
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Access to the audio element
You can get direct access to the underlying audio element.  First get a ref to ReactAudioPlayer:

```jsx
<ReactAudioPlayer
  ref={c => this.player = c}
/>
```

Then you can access the audio element like this:

`this.player.audio`
